A package of modules to process and analyze neural recordings as individual voltage time series. The primary purpose of this library is to serve as the shared codebase for the [Voytek Lab](http://voyteklab.com/), but we welcome anyone's use and contributions.

## Python version support
This package currently supports python 3 (tested on 3.6), but not python 2.

## Get latest code

`$ git clone https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp.git`

## Install latest release of neurodsp

`$ pip install neurodsp`
